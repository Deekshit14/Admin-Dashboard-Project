<h1>Frontend Admin Dashboard Project</h1>

<p>
  This project is a responsive admin dashboard built using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, where I explored and implemented several important frontend concepts. During the development process, I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React Components:</strong> Structured the UI using reusable components for better organization and maintainability.</li>
  <li><strong>React Routes:</strong> Implemented routing for navigation between different views within the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Recharts:</strong> Learned how to integrate and use <a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a> to display data visualizations and graphs effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Material UI:</strong> Utilized <a href="https://mui.com/">Material UI</a> components and themes to design a modern and responsive interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Grid Box CSS:</strong> Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Ensured the dashboard is fully responsive and works across all screen sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of frontend development while creating a clean, functional, and responsive user interface.
